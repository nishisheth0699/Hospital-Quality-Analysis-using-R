Heart disease is the biggest killer of both men and women in the United States and around the world. Statistical analysis has identified many risk factors associated with heart disease. In this project, we run statistical tests and regression models using the Cleveland heart disease dataset to assess one particular factor â€“ the maximum heart rate one can achieve during exercise and how it is associated with a higher likelihood of getting heart disease.
